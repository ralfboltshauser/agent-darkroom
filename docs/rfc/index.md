# RFCs — Request for Comments

RFCs explore open technical questions with deliberation. Each RFC names a question, frames the alternatives honestly, and proposes a path forward. RFCs close into ADRs once a decision is made.

RFCs are not implementation specs and not justifications-after-the-fact. They're real deliberation captured.

## Reference

- `../adr/TA.md` — technical architecture. Every RFC anchors here via `TA/components/...` or `TA/constraints`.
- `RFC_TEMPLATE.md` — the format every RFC follows.

## Maturity legend

- **Draft v0.1** — written; deliberation captured; awaiting implementation evidence to close
- **Draft v0.1 (speculative)** — question identified but problem isn't real yet (e.g. vocabulary too small to need discovery tooling); placeholder until it becomes pressing
- **Draft v0.1 (deferred)** — question identified, deliberately not being argued in this round; revisit later
- **Accepted** — design decision settled; closing ADRs lock the structural pieces. Distinct from "Decided" because the RFC remains a living reference for the rationale.
- **Accepted (design); built Phase X** — design accepted now, implementation deferred to a named phase
- **Decided** — closed into one or more ADRs; remains as historical record

## Conventions

- Numbered sequentially (`RFC-NNN-slug.md`)
- Every RFC has a "Why this is an RFC" gating sentence in the header
- "Alternatives considered" must list real alternatives with honest reasons for rejection
- An RFC that argues for something already-decided is an ADR; close and start over
