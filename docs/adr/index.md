# ADRs — Architecture Decision Records

ADRs lock single decisions with rationale. Short. Append-only. Never edited after acceptance — superseded by new ADRs if circumstances change.

ADRs come from two streams:
- **Direct ADRs** — small decisions that don't need an RFC's deliberation
- **RFC-closure ADRs** — written when an RFC closes; one RFC may close into multiple ADRs

## Reference

- `TA.md` — technical architecture. Every ADR anchors here via `TA/components/...` or `TA/constraints`.
- `ADR_TEMPLATE.md` — the format every ADR follows.

## Conventions

- Numbered sequentially (`ADR-NNN-slug.md`)
- Append-only — once Accepted, never edited
- Superseded ADRs stay in the record with `Status · Superseded by ADR-NNN`
- Every ADR references its TA anchor
- Short by design — full deliberation lives in the related RFC if there was one
- **Gaps in numbering are deliberate.** ADR-065 is intentionally unused: during the parallel authoring of RFC-018's and RFC-019's closing ADRs, both initially claimed 063–065. The conflict was resolved by giving RFC-018 → 063+064 and shifting RFC-019 → 066+067+068. The gap is preserved rather than re-numbered (per the append-only rule applied to the registry as a whole).
