# Mask-applicable controls

> Companion to ADR-076 (drawn-mask-only architecture). What can be applied through a mask, what can't, how to do it.
>
> **Visual one-pager:** [`docs/diagrams/mask-trilogy.md`](../diagrams/mask-trilogy.md) renders the v1.9.0+v1.10.0 mask architecture — the four mask sources (drawn / parametric / LLM-vision / retouch) plus named-mask references, all converging on one `mask_spec` wire that serializes to XMP `masks_history`.

Chemigram can bind many vocabulary primitives to a drawn mask region (gradient, ellipse, or rectangle). Check each new module with `compare --difference`: a valid XMP mask does not guarantee that a module's rendered effect stays inside that region. Masked exposure and tone equalizer were verified on a real RAW in darktable 5.6.2. The CLI rejects masked `bilat` after a real trial showed a large effect outside the ellipse.

This guide answers three questions:

1. What does the engine do when you mask a primitive?
2. Which primitives are reasonable to mask, and which aren't?
3. How do you mask an arbitrary primitive?

---

## 1. What the engine does when you mask a primitive

`apply_with_drawn_mask(baseline, dtstyle, mask_spec)`:

1. Builds a `DrawnMaskForm` from `mask_spec` (a `gradient | ellipse | rectangle` schema with darktable-native parameters).
2. Patches **every plugin's** 420-byte `blendop_params` blob in the dtstyle:
   - `mask_mode = ENABLED | MASK = 3` (drawn mask on)
   - `mask_id = <form id>`
   - `opacity = 100.0` (default)
3. Synthesizes a new XMP applying that patched dtstyle on top of the baseline.
4. Injects `<darktable:masks_history>` with the form encoded in darktable's wire format (verified against `darktable 5.4.1` source: `src/develop/masks.h`, `src/common/exif.cc`).

The patched XMP, when rendered by `darktable-cli`, applies the primitive's effect *only* in the masked region (with the form's natural feathering / falloff), leaving the rest of the frame untouched.

**This works the same way for every vocabulary entry.** The unit test [`test_apply_universality`](https://github.com/chipi/chemigram/blob/main/tests/unit/core/masking/test_apply_universality.py) verifies the apply path completes for every loaded entry × every drawn-form spec. There are no "this primitive can't be masked" cases in the engine.

The interesting questions are at the photographic layer: does masking a particular module *make sense*, and does darktable's renderer produce the result you'd expect?

---

## 2. Compatibility matrix

The matrix below maps each darktable module touched by the chemigram vocabulary to "is it useful to mask?" and "is the photographic result well-defined?" The mechanical apply path works for everything in the **Engine** column; the **Photographic** column is where the nuance lives.

| Module | Vocabulary entries | Engine | Photographic | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `exposure` | `expo_+0.5`, `expo_-0.5`, `expo_+0.3`, `expo_-0.3`, `shadows_global_+/-`, `gradient_*`, `radial_*`, `rectangle_*` | ✅ | ✅ | The 4 shipped masked primitives use this. EV deltas through a region are the canonical use case (dodge/burn). |
| `colorbalancergb` | `saturation_global` (parameterized), `vibrance_+0.3`, `grade_*`, `chroma_boost_*` | ✅ | ✅ | Saturation and grading through a region work cleanly — collapse a background to monochrome, warm the subject, etc. Verified by [`test_lab_grade_masked_universality`](https://github.com/chipi/chemigram/blob/main/tests/e2e/test_lab_grade_masked_universality.py) (`saturation_global --value -1.0` through a center mask leaves corner chroma intact). |
| `sigmoid` | `contrast_low/high`, `blacks_lifted/crushed`, `whites_open` | ✅ | ⚠️ Use with care | s-curves are tone benders — applying one in a region can produce visible seam where the curve transitions between masked and unmasked areas. Soft falloff helps. Sometimes the right call; sometimes you want a global contrast move and a regional luma move instead. |
| `bilat` (localcontrast) | `clarity_strong`, `clarity_painterly` | No | No | Disabled after a real darktable 5.6.2 render changed pixels outside the intended ellipse. |
| `vignette` | `vignette_subtle/medium/heavy` | ✅ | ❌ Don't | The vignette module is itself geometric — it produces a radial darkening centered on the frame. Pairing it with a mask is two competing geometries; the result is rarely what you want. Use exposure-through-a-mask for region darkening instead. |
| `temperature` (white balance) | `temperature` (parameterized; multi-axis red_coeff + blue_coeff), `wb_warm_subtle` (starter discrete) | ✅ | ⚠️ Pipeline-position caveat | `temperature` runs early in darktable's pipeline (before `colorin`), so masking it has a *different visual effect* than masking a downstream color move — empirically the mask binding is silently ignored at render time on this module. For "warm the subject", prefer `grade_highlights_warm` or a `colorbalancergb` move (e.g., `temperature` is structurally unmask-able; `colorbalancergb` axes are not) through a mask — the photographic result is more predictable. |
| `channelmixerrgb` | (currently unused; planned in #63) | ✅ | ✅ | When the v1.6.0 B&W trio ships, mask binding will follow the colorbalancergb pattern (mid-pipeline, uniform per-patch effect). |
| `grain` | `grain_fine/medium/heavy` | ✅ | ⚠️ Edge artifact risk | Grain texture is randomized per-pixel; through a mask, you'll see a visible boundary where grain stops. Acceptable if the mask has soft falloff and the grain is subtle. |
| `highlights` | `highlights_recovery_subtle/strong` | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited usefulness | Highlights recovery operates on raw / pre-demosaic data; it works through the mask but the photographic value of "recover only some highlights" is rare. Usually you either want all highlights recovered or none. |

### Legend

- **Engine ✅**: `apply_with_drawn_mask` completes cleanly; the rendered XMP is well-formed.
- **Photographic ✅**: The masked render produces what the photographer would intuitively expect.
- **Photographic ⚠️**: It renders, but think carefully — there's a caveat (seam, pipeline position, edge artifact).
- **Photographic ❌**: Don't. The combination doesn't make photographic sense.

### Per-module rationale (anchor targets)

Stable link targets for the per-row notes in the [visual proofs gallery](visual-proofs.md). One short paragraph per module with the rationale already implied by the matrix above.

<a id="temperature"></a>
**`temperature`** — drawn-mask binding is silently ignored at render time. darktable's temperature module runs early in the pipeline (before `colorin`), and the masking machinery operates on data that's already been white-balanced. Empirically, a masked `wb_warm_subtle` produces a render byte-identical to its global counterpart. Consequence: the gallery suppresses the masked column for `wb_*` entries; for "warm the subject," reach for `grade_highlights_warm` or a `colorbalancergb` move with a mask instead.

<a id="vignette"></a>
**`vignette`** — geometric × geometric is a contradiction. The `vignette` module produces its own radial intensity profile peaking at the frame edges; a centered ellipse mask is `1` where the vignette is `0`, and vice versa. The two geometries cancel; the masked render returns near-baseline. Consequence: the gallery suppresses the masked column for `vignette_*` entries. For region darkening, reach for `exposure` through a mask.

<a id="highlights"></a>
**`highlights`** — works through a mask, but only matters where input has clipping. The synthetic ColorChecker chart has no blown highlights, so the rendered effect is below the visible threshold. Consequence: the gallery annotates `highlights_recovery_*` rows as near-baseline-on-this-input rather than suppressing them; on a real raw with clipped sky or specular highlights the masked variant is photographically meaningful.

<a id="grain"></a>
**`grain`** — works through a mask, but the texture is hard to see on flat chart patches. Grain is per-pixel high-frequency noise; on uniform colored patches the diff vs baseline is small. Consequence: the gallery annotates `grain_*` rows as near-baseline-on-this-input. On a real photograph with continuous tone the grain is clearly visible inside the mask region.

## 3. How to mask an arbitrary primitive

Three paths: direct CLI, vocabulary authoring, and Python.

### From the CLI (one-off, ad hoc masking)

`chemigram apply-primitive` accepts `--mask-spec '<json>'` to apply any primitive through an ad-hoc drawn mask:

```bash
chemigram apply-primitive <image_id> --entry saturation_global \
  --pack expressive-baseline \
  --value -1.0 \
  --mask-spec '{"dt_form":"ellipse","dt_params":{"center_x":0.5,"center_y":0.5,"radius_x":0.3,"radius_y":0.3,"border":0.1}}'
```

The JSON shape matches the manifest's `mask_spec` field (gradient / ellipse / rectangle with their `dt_params` — schema reference below). When both `--mask-spec` and the entry's manifest `mask_spec` are present, the CLI flag overrides — useful for re-shaping a shipped masked entry on a specific photograph.

For repeatable moves, prefer authoring a vocabulary entry that bakes the mask in (next section); the CLI flag is for ad-hoc work.

### Authoring a mask-bound vocabulary entry

The 4 shipped masked entries are good templates. A masked `.dtstyle` is just a regular `.dtstyle` file — the binding lives in the manifest entry, not the file:

```json
{
  "name": "subject_warm_lift",
  "layer": "L3",
  "subtype": "colorbalancergb",
  "path": "layers/L3/colorbalancergb/subject_warm_lift.dtstyle",
  "touches": ["colorbalancergb"],
  "tags": ["subject", "warm", "mask", "radial"],
  "description": "Warm highlights + chroma boost on the subject only.",
  "modversions": {"colorbalancergb": 5},
  "darktable_version": "5.4",
  "source": "personal",
  "license": "MIT",
  "mask_spec": {
    "dt_form": "ellipse",
    "dt_params": {
      "center_x": 0.5,
      "center_y": 0.5,
      "radius_x": 0.25,
      "radius_y": 0.3,
      "border": 0.1
    }
  }
}
```

When the engine applies this entry, `apply_with_drawn_mask` automatically routes through the masked path because `mask_spec is not None`. The `.dtstyle` file itself is the global version of the move; the manifest's `mask_spec` overlays the geometry at apply time. See [`authoring-vocabulary-entries.md`](authoring-vocabulary-entries.md) for the full flow.

### From an MCP agent (one-off, ad hoc masking)

The `apply_primitive` MCP tool accepts an optional `mask_spec` argument with the same JSON shape:

```json
{
  "tool": "apply_primitive",
  "args": {
    "image_id": "<id>",
    "primitive_name": "saturation_global",
    "value": -1.0,
    "mask_spec": {
      "dt_form": "ellipse",
      "dt_params": {
        "center_x": 0.5, "center_y": 0.5,
        "radius_x": 0.3, "radius_y": 0.3,
        "border": 0.1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Same precedence as the CLI: `mask_spec` from the agent overrides the entry's manifest `mask_spec` if both are present.

### From Python (programmatic, one-off)

```python
from chemigram.core.helpers import apply_entry
from chemigram.core.vocab import load_packs
from chemigram.core.xmp import parse_xmp

baseline = parse_xmp(workspace / "current.xmp")
vocab = load_packs(["starter", "expressive-baseline"])

# Pick any global primitive
entry = vocab.lookup_by_name("saturation_global")

# Apply it at -1.0 (kill saturation) through a centered radial mask
mask_spec = {
    "dt_form": "ellipse",
    "dt_params": {
        "center_x": 0.5, "center_y": 0.5,
        "radius_x": 0.3, "radius_y": 0.3,
        "border": 0.1,
    },
}
applied = apply_entry(
    baseline, entry,
    parameter_values={"saturation_global": -1.0},
    mask_spec=mask_spec,
)
# `applied` is a new Xmp with saturation_global bound to the ellipse.
# Render it through `chemigram.core.pipeline.render(...)`.
```

`mask_spec` schemas:

| Form | Required keys | Optional keys |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| `gradient` | `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`, `rotation` | `compression`, `steepness`, `curvature`, `state` |
| `ellipse` | `center_x`, `center_y`, `radius_x`, `radius_y` | `rotation`, `border`, `flags` |
| `rectangle` | `x0`, `y0`, `x1`, `y1` | `border` |

All coordinates are normalized image coordinates `[0, 1]`. See `chemigram.core.masking.dt_serialize` for parameter semantics (with citations to the darktable source for each field).

## 4. Beyond drawn masks — parametric refinement and retouch (v1.9.0)

The matrix above covers `apply_primitive` with a drawn `mask_spec`. v1.9.0 adds two further axes:

### Parametric range refinement (RFC-024 / ADR-085)

`mask_spec` now supports an optional `range_filter` field that intersects the spatial mask with pixel-level criteria:

```jsonc
mask_spec = {
    "dt_form": "ellipse",                                    // spatial (RFC-029)
    "dt_params": {"center_x": 0.5, "center_y": 0.5, ...},
    "range_filter": {                                         // pixel-level (RFC-024)
        "kind": "luminance",   // or color_h / color_s / color_l
        "min": 0.0, "max": 0.3, "feather": 0.05, "invert": false
    }
}
```

Three valid combinations: drawn only (existing), parametric only (`range_filter` without `dt_form`), drawn + parametric (intersection — "the dark pixels in this ellipse"). Composes with every primitive in the matrix above. See `mask-shapes-from-words.md` for example phrases and `range_filter` semantics.

### Retouch (spot heal/clone) — a new primitive class (RFC-025 / ADR-087)

`apply_spot` is a new MCP tool sister to `apply_primitive`. It's not in the matrix above because it's a structurally different primitive class — it *replaces* pixels (heal/clone) rather than filtering an effect:

```python
apply_spot(image_id, kind="heal", x=0.4, y=0.2, radius=0.05)         # remove blemish
apply_spot(image_id, kind="clone", x=0.6, y=0.4, radius=0.04,
           source_x=0.4, source_y=0.4)                                # mirror feature
```

v1.9.0 scope: HEAL + CLONE on CIRCLE geometry, single form per call. Multi-form batched detection (AI auto-spots) routes to RFC-030's deployed-provider scaffolding when that ships. BLUR + FILL algorithms and ellipse / path geometries deferred until evidence demands.

### LLM-vision provider (RFC-026 / ADR-086)

For "where's the subject" / "what hue range matches the sky" workflows, the LLM in your chat client looks at a `render_preview` and constructs `mask_spec` from spatial reasoning. Zero deployment cost, conversation-native. See `llm-vision-for-masks.md` for the workflow patterns.

---

## 5. Verifying mask localization on a custom primitive

If you author a masked entry and want laboratory-grade confirmation that it's localizing correctly:

1. **Add an entry to `EXPECTED_EFFECTS`** in [`tests/e2e/_lab_grade_deltas.py`](https://github.com/chipi/chemigram/blob/main/tests/e2e/_lab_grade_deltas.py), using `_check_zone_dampen` or `_check_zone_lift` with the appropriate ColorChecker zones (constants `_CC_TOP_HALF`, `_CC_CENTER_4`, etc.).
2. **Run the lab-grade suite**: `pytest tests/e2e/test_lab_grade_primitives.py -v`. The chart-based isolation will measure your primitive's spatial effect against synthetic ColorChecker patches and tell you whether the mask is localizing as expected.
3. **For module-level validation** (a category not yet in `MASK_COVERAGE`), add to [`tests/e2e/test_lab_grade_masked_universality.py`](https://github.com/chipi/chemigram/blob/main/tests/e2e/test_lab_grade_masked_universality.py).

The visual gallery at [`docs/guides/visual-proofs.md`](visual-proofs.md) shows the rendered before/after for every primitive (including the 4 mask-bound ones). The lab-grade tests check the same renders programmatically.
