"""End-to-end pixel-level validation against a real darktable render.

Synthesizes XMPs via ``chemigram.core.xmp.synthesize_xmp`` + the bundled
starter vocabulary, renders each through real ``darktable-cli`` against
the Phase 0 test raw, and asserts the rendered JPEG's pixel statistics
moved in the expected direction.

These tests are the missing layer between unit tests (parser /
synthesizer correctness on opaque blobs) and "trust me, it renders" —
they validate that the full chain *actually does the right thing* on a
real photo, not just that bytes come back.

Tolerances are deliberately generous: tests need to survive image
content (dark vs bright scenes, different cameras), darktable version
drift within 5.x, and JPEG quantization noise. Direction-of-change is
the assertion, not exact magnitudes.

Skipped automatically when:
- ``darktable-cli`` is missing
- ``CHEMIGRAM_TEST_RAW`` (or the default Phase 0 raw) is missing
- ``CHEMIGRAM_DT_CONFIGDIR`` (or the default Phase 0 configdir) is missing

# is not a neutral starting state — it's the Phase 0 reference XMP, which
# has +2.0 EV baked into its exposure entry. SET-replace semantics
# (ADR-002) mean that applying e.g. expo_+0.5 *replaces* the +2.0 EV with
# +0.5 EV, producing a *darker* image than the rendered baseline.
#
# That's correct SET behavior, but it makes "applying expo_+0.5 brightens
# the baseline" a wrong expectation for these tests. We assert relative
# direction between the two exposure primitives instead — that holds
# regardless of where the baseline sits — and against a future slice
# where workspace ingest generates a neutral baseline via darktable-cli,
# these tests will keep working unchanged.
